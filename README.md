Implementation of two-pass assembler in Java.  

<b>Pass 1</b> generates:
- Literal table
- Symbol table  
- Pool table  

<b>Pass 2</b> generates intermediate code.  

A few assumptions are made for the assembly code input. Read them [here](https://github.com/athkarandikar/two-pass-assembler/blob/main/assumptions.txt).
