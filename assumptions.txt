Machine instructions are case-insensitive
After the ORIGIN instruction, only one word can follow (the math expression should be one word including the symbol)
The ORIGIN instruction can only include following opcode:
    constant
    symbol (not literals) and a + if necessary (written without whitespace)
EQU operates only on symbols
DC is not used
No comments are allowed
After LTORG, it is optional to write literals that are not assigned addresses are written, each on a separate line
END is the last instruction, and literals that are not assigned addresses are assigned addresses
